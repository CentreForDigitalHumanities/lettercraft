# Lettercraft & Epistolary Performance in Medieval Europe frontend

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. This will not start the backend, to developing with a functioning backend use `yarn start` from the project root instead. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`, which will forward to the frontend.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
